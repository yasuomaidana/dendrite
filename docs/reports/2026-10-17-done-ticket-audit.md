# Done / To Verify Ticket Audit (2026-10-17)

Audit of every Plane ticket that was marked `Done` or `To Verify` in the Dendrite Core project, against the real source code. Per-ticket verdicts were produced by AGY (Gemini 3.8 Flash) reading the code with measured `go test -cover` evidence, spot-checked by Claude (one false 'not implemented' verdict, DEN-702, was overridden after a code check), and applied to Plane through `dendrite plane update` and `dendrite dev ticket set` (DEN-917).

## Summary

- Tickets audited: **139**
- Implemented: **91** · partial: **14** · not implemented: **34**
- Flagged as under-specified: **91**; descriptions rebuilt in Plane to the ticket schema (context, targets, entry points, acceptance criteria, verification): **73**
- Moved back from `Done`/`To Verify`: **51** (implemented `Done` tickets keep their human sign-off)
- Coverage below the 100% goal does not demote a ticket on its own; it is tracked by the per-package coverage ratchet (DEN-986).
